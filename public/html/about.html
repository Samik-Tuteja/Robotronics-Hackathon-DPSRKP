                    organisation found in the year 2021. It focuses on the education of the disabled children. 
                    The word "EDUCABLE" here means "Education for the Disable" and that is what we are doing. As 
                    every person has the right to education in this world then why they are deprived of their rights, 
                    therefore, Educabke aims to provide the best possible education available. Our organisation is 
                    here to make this possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The children or their guardian can access our website easily and enroll themselves 
                    to get a teacher of any subject that they are interested in studying or for any 
                    extra-curricular activities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also have facilities for the elders with disability that they can become a teacher in our 
                    organisation and can teach the students. It would also be better for the children to learn 
                    from the teacher of their kind because the teacher would be able to explain the child properly.
